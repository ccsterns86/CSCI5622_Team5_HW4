2,p11,Interviewer: So  tell me about yourself. |Interviewee: Uhh  I’m a junior at MIT  uhh I’m double majoring in Management and Biology  er  I’m very interested in the world of finance  uh  business  consulting all of those sorts of things. Um  so I’ve tried to take on different leadership roles that would prepare me for uh  those sort of roles in the business world. Outside of school  I enjoy running  cross-country and track  I’m on the varsity team at MIT. And umm  I’m also very involved in Greek Life at MIT  so I’m on the Panhellenic Executive Board as Vice President of Programming  and also hold a leadership position in my sorority. |Interviewer: Great  okay. Can you tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee: Umm  so I think this past year  my biggest priority has been my position as Vice President of Programming for Panhellenic and umm  just in that position  uhh  I hold a leadership role on the exec board. We have weekly meetings  I’m charge of putting together our programming calendar for our entire year. So I have interface with a lot of MIT faculty and bring together the exec board as a whole and the different sororities uhh  to meet and attend different events. And I think to put together all these events I’m working together with different people on campus I have to show leadership and show strong communication skills. |Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you were working on a team  and faced a challenge. How did you guys overcome that?|Interviewee: Umm  so I guess this past semester actually  I’m associate advisor for umm  freshmen and I work with my freshmen advisor as well and another associate advisor  and er   the three of us were trying to come up with an event to host for the freshman and I think we all  er  were very uhh  set on our ideas. So having to full time communicate and work on an idea that could bring all our thoughts and goals together . Um  so we had to work together to formulate some sort of event that would satisfy each of our different goals and that was difficult at first  ‘cause we had just met each other and it was difficult to understand where the other people were coming from. But after that  and after communicating what our main goals for the event for would be  we eventually figured out what we wanted to do. |Interviewer: Can you be more specific about that  what you eventually figured out?|Interviewee: Uhh  yeah so  we had — we were trying to communicate via email at first  so I think that was  uhh inefficient  especially since we had only met in a group once before  umm so meeting in person and really  trying to outline not just like   what the event was going to be  what our purpose of the event was going to be  and what we trying to communicate with the freshmen. I think by boiling down to what our purpose was for the event  we were able to build it up from there. |Interviewer: Okay  so can tell me about some of your weakness? Do you have any idea? |Interviewee: Umm  so I think one of my weaknesses is public speaking  actually  and uhh  I think by taking a variety of classes  especially this one class that I’m in  that focuses on management and communication . I’ve been kind of thrown into positions where I have to give impromptu speeches  uhh  and debate my point in different arguments and I think that the practice is helping me a lot and it allows me to become more comfortable and more confident in what I’m saying  which I think helps me in the long run like public speaking in general. I think I’ve been able to build up my confidence and know like  how to structure my speeches and interviews and impromptus better. |Interviewer: Great. So why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Uhh  I think my different leadership positions as well as my academic experience  umm would allow me to perform well on the job. I think  I’ve worked umm  both individually in a project as well as in a team-focused environment  which umm  I think is key for consulting and investment banking positions. I also feel that my MIT background  uh  the quantitative analysis that I’ve done in classes  as well as my internship experiences would help perform well on the job as well  so…|Interviewer: Great.,4.818498154755453,4.479785084791125
9,p20,Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: Good. How are you?|Interviewer: Good. So  tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Um  so I'm a junior at MIT. I'm majoring in environmental engineering.|Interviewer: Mmhmm|Interviewee: Um  and so I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology  environmental transport. Um  I've done internships previously with environmental restoration companies.|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: And I also participated in research last summer.|Interviewer: Career goals?|Interviewee: Um  I'd like to go to Grad school after I graduate in Environmental Enginneering again.|Interviewer: Great. So  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Um  so this semester I became President of the Women's Independent Living Group.|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: Um  after being House Manager last semester. So I've worked through a lot of problems within the house in trying to kind of get the right atmosphere in the house.|Interviewer: Can you be a little bit more specific?|Interviewee: Um  So as house manager  um  I organized work week at the beginning of this year. So it's a time when - there's about 30 members in the house and everybody gets together and  um  works on the house  paints rooms  like fixes it up before the school year starts. So I organized that  assigned jobs to people and facilitated that.|Interviewer: Okay  great. Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Um  so I'm also on the rowing team.|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: And I'm not sure if this is exactly what you're looking for  but I guess  I was in the second boat last year and we were having a lot of problems throughout the season kind of like we would go to a race and we would be okay  but we weren't performing up to our standards. And so it was a big struggle for me to try and figure out how to kind of help turn the attitude around in the boat. Um  and we were finally able to pull it off in our very last race and we won the semi-finals at Patriot League. So I think it's the right mix of like knowing when to speak up say something and knowing what to say.|Interviewer: So the way you change the attitude was by?|Interviewee: Um  kind of by speaking up and letting people know not like putting people down  but letting people know that there was way more potential to be had.|Interviewer: Okay. Great. And can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Um  one of my weaknesses  I tend to be  I guess  a little more withdrawn sometimes. Um  and that's something I've been working on like I've taken leadership in my house and as the rowing team  um  but I think something good about that is I tend to be a very good listener. |Interviewer: Mmhmm|And then I'm starting to learn when to speak up and become more of a like up-front role.|Interviewer: Great. And last question. Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  I think I'm like extremely responsible.|Interviewer: Mmhmm|Interviewee: Um  I have a lot of experience. And this is something that I think will help further my career goals and something I'm really excited about learning about. And so I'll put a lot of effort into this project.|Interviewer: Great.,4.883647533744052,4.526187361476851
24,p4,Interviewer: So  how are you doin'?|Interviewee: Pretty good.|Interviewer: Mmhmm. So  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Uhh  so I'm a junior uhh studying aeronautics and astronautics at MIT. |Interviewer: Mmhmm.|Interviewee: Umm  so right now I'm currently in the middle of my junior year. I'm looking for a summer internship company and uhh-|Interviewer: Mmhmm. Tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: OK. Umm  so for example last year umm when we were working on a class project where we were uhh trying to design a G- uhh sorry a jet engine for GE. |Interviewer: Mmhmm.|Interviewee: Umm I had to work with a group of 4 people umm and to try to optimize certain uhh certain parameters for this engine. Uhh- that we would have to present at uhh something to present to GE engineers. Umm during that time one of my team members uhh actually got really sick and he actually had to uhh go medical for a couple days and he wasn't really able to do much. And uhh another person ended up uhh sh- wasn't showing up very much so during that time I sort of basically had to facilitate uhh the people who weren't sick uhh and basically help them communicate  talk to each other  and set up meetings. Uhh  I sort of took the helm on uhh towards uhh towards the end on a lot of that and basically got everybody together to to complete this project.|Interviewer: Mmhmm. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and were faced with a different challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Umm uhh umm so over the summer I was working at at Auburn University.|Interviewer: Mmhmm.|Interviewee: Um I was doing uhh UAV collision avoidance algorithms.|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: So like uhh programming things to allow to allow a whole bunch of UAVs flying in the same airspace uhh to basically get to their directives without crashing into each other. Umm I was working with a partner  but in a larger context of umm a dozen students. Umm as it turns out umm the challenge in this case was that although it was sort of like a programming AI sort of aeronautics umm sort of project  uhh my partner came from a chemical engineering background and did not really have any programming experience nor she had she had experience with umm with sort of UAV design. Umm so that became a bit of an issue  umm but umm I think basically what ended up happening was I worked with umm a grad student there and like all the people to basically bring her up to speed. Basically sort of teach her programming from the ground up  up to a level where she might be able to help with programming like in a uhh a uhh for UAV. And umm in that case I drew upon a lot of resources that were available there. Umm you know there were grad students who were helping helping us  the professor who was in charge of the ex- uhh the project as well as with other students in the program.|Interviewer: Tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome it.|Interviewee: Ummm  so I think one of my weaknesses is that umm I have a tendency to to show up uhh to things kind to things kind of late. Umm this is actually probably after I'm used to after I'm used to going to a certain place umm because I have a tendency to think that  and especially in the mornings because I have a tendency to think oh I can get to a certain place uhh by biking uhh at a certain speed. So  I think uhh what I tend to do uhh what I'm trying to do nowadays to try to overcome that is basically get to somewhere before hand and then basically uhh do work there as opposed to try to do work umm away from a place where I need to be and like sort of try to make it there in the nick of time. It's something that I've tried to implement over the past couple weeks.|Interviewer: Now  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Umm I think you should hire me  because umm basically I've demonstrated over the past couple years umm a fair amount of research experience  a fair amount of experience in and out umm in and out of the classroom in both umm sort of an academic setting and in a research and development setting uhh such that I think I would be an asset to your company. Umm I think that my past experience with both uhh software and hardwares in aeronautics makes it so that uhh I have a good balance that would be useful to you.|Interviewer: Oh  thank-,4.098175077681842,3.5933178098163285
26,p43,Interviewer: So  can you tell me about yourself?|Interviewee: Sure  so I'm a senior at MIT in management and computer science. Uhm  I'm really interested in the intersection of the two. So  you know  not just  uhm  you know  how computers can  you know  you know  how  like the best algorithms to do about computers? like you know inventing the next algorithm  the next compression algorithm  not really something that I'm interested in doing. But uh really finding how computers can help apply to peoples lives and make new businesses or improve existing businesses. |Interviewer: Excellent. Let me open my questions up here. So  uhm  can you tell of a time where you demonstrate leadership?|Interviewee: Sure  so  uhm  I guess I'd say earlier this year. So I'm actually the president of Baker house and earlier in the beginning of the year in MIT we had this process called REX; Residence Exploration where all the dorms try and throw events and somehow  you know  recruit or retain the freshmen that they have. Uhm  and  the REX Event that we had uh  we threw a bunch of events  had about ten workers that we had  were able to give early arrival to. So free housing. Uh  so we ran about five or six events the largest of which was a party where we had over seven-hundred people attend. |Interviewer: Wow. So can you tell me about a time where you're working on a team and face a challenge? how did you go about resolving it?|Interviewee: Sure. So I think there's  you know  always been challenges. So last summer when I was at Disney  uhm  there were  there was some disagreement about uh  how we should  when we should schedule  the  uh  what week we should schedule the  uh  trial for. Uhm  and there was some disagreement about whether we should have it later because of uhm  uh  dates for when the program would be ready but if we had it passed a certain date then we'd have to have the app also consider time zone issues. So basically just discussed with all the stake holders and let them know that  you know  by changing this date  pushing it back  we're adding scope to the app and we're going to have to make additional development changes and see if they would be able to be flexible to change it back. |Interviewer: Ahh  that makes sense.|Interviewee: Yep.|Interviewer: Uhm  so  uh  tell me about your greatest weakness and what you've done to over come it. |Interviewee: Sure. So I think the  the problem  uhm  that I have the most is  uh  in delegating task to people. So  uhm  I want to make sure that things are done properly so I tend to overly control on things. So basically I've been thinking to myself alright is this something core that I really have to do? no. I think let's. you know  lets get someone else to do it  and that way also they also they learn it so  you know  when I graduate they're able to take on that role. |Interviewer: Mhmm. Uhm. Thanks. So I guess thinking  uhm  about a job that you like to apply for.|Interviewee: Sure.|Interviewer: Uh  Why should we hire you for this position?|Interviewee: Sure. I think uhm  I combine  you know  technical expertise with uh  business expertise and product expertise. So  hiring me as a product manager for your mobile app I think is  uh  would be optimal because I have expertise in all these areas and I've worked in all these areas in the past  uhm  and I'm able to bring that expertise to your organization in a way that I think few other candidates  uhm  have. |Interviewer: Ah  well thank you for coming.|Interviewee: Thank you for having me.,5.630818126591222,5.774952328956782
27,p44,Interviewer: Um  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Okay  um  my name's Evan  Evan Muray  I'm a junior here at MIT in computer science. I'm originally from Louisville Kentucky. And  uh  yeah I currently live across the river. I heard about this study through e-mail. So  thought I'd check it out.|Interviewer: So  I lived in Louisville.|Interviewee: You did?|Interviewer: Yeah.|Interviewee: Nice.|Interviewer: Anyway. So can you tell me about a time when you served as a leader?|Interviewee: A leader? Uh sure. Um. A good example of that would be uh some of my extra curricular work  activities  so I'm involved in uh two activities in general that showcase my leadership skills. One is Camp Kesem MIT which is a student organization here on campus at MIT uh each summer the organization puts on a summer camp for children who's parents have or have had cancer. Um  and I serve on the coordinator board for this organization. Um  in the past I was in charge of handling applications and contacting families of campers who'd would come to our camp and being in contact with them throughout the year  send them newsletters  send them updates  plan reunions for them. Uh this year I am in charge of asking the students on campus and getting students to apply to become counselors for our camp and (inaudible) with students  so I work as a coordinator I actually have a co-coordinator  we usually work in tandem. The other activity is dance troop. It's another student organization here at MIT  where we put on a show each year and dance  have some fun  it's a dance show  and I'm a choreography for that organization as well. I lead a dance  teach people some dance moves for some fun.|Interviewer: Oh  that's all very excellent.|Interviewee: Thanks.|Interviewer: So  can you tell me a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you solve the problem?|Interviewee: Sure  uh  I think a great example of that would be this past January  I participated in a web design competition here on campus  6470  I was on a team with my girlfriend and a mutual friend of ours. It's always different working in a group with your friends as opposed to just hanging out with them. There was a bit of conflict about how we wanted the website to go. We had different visions for how we wanted it to look  and I think for me the best way that I handled that was to sort of be willing to compromise because I think it's a very important skill and also just listening  active listening. I was listening to why she wanted to make certain changes to the website. And by doing that  um  I was able to uh figure out uh sort of like a common ground that we could work towards  I think we eventually did hit um and were able to move forward with this one conflict that I definitely remember because it was pretty big at the time but  I mean  we needed to get through it.|Interviewer: So tell me one of your greatest weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.|Interviewee: My greatest weakness... Hm. Okay. Uh. I'd say my  one of my bigger weaknesses is  uh  I'd say  probably uh  self-starting  actually. It's something I've been working  it's like my goal for this year  to work on. In the past I would do my classes  take my classes  and really just kind of do my schoolwork significantly outside of classes. If there's one thing I learned from being around all these amazing people here at MIT  is if you have an idea just go for it. It's very easy  especially here  there's resources to do so  and  it's something that I want to work on  I have some ideas for projects I want to start on my own. It's always been an issue for me to actually start on things and come up with ideas and really get started on certain projects. But  this  I plan on starting my own website and doing some ideas with that  and hopefully I will gain some more experience in computer sciences.|Interviewer: Excellent. So uh think of a job you'd like to get hired for  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Uh  I think one of my best qualities is the ability to really quickly  coming to MIT for example  I came to MIT with very little experience in the field computer science. Many of my past internships  I've been going to  I don't have much experience  but I pride myself in the sort of grasp ideas quickly and uh build on top of those and use those to build solutions to problems. I find that  uh  after doing some examples of a certain problem  or just playing around with it for a little bit  I can get to work on using that sort of technology. In the past couple internships  I've had to deal with new languages  new framework  and I think that definitely more then compensates for any experience I'm lacking.|Interviewer: Excellent. Thanks again for coming again.|Interviewee: No problem  thank you for having me.|Interviewer: Of course!,5.317293459614781,4.599058371573568
30,p48,Interviewer:  How are you|Interviewee:  I'm doing well|Interviewer:  Excellent.  So  uh  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee:  Uh  I'm a student  I study computer science.  Uh  I'm in my last year so when I graduate in May I'm going to be working on computer science stuff|Interviewer:  Mhm.  Now I'm going to ask you a series of questions  um  starting out with tell me a time where you demonstrate leadership|Interviewee:  I demonstrate leadership on the track team  I was senior pole vaulter on the team so uh right now were doing uh the conditioning and stuff like that and all through the preseason a lot freshmen come and its important to get them up to speed so the uh  seniors on the team myself included uh   lead them though the workouts and stuff like that and its important to be able to...to stand up and let them know how the tradition is and stuff like that.|Interviewer:  Tell me a time where you were working on a team and you were faced with a challenge.  How did you end up solving the problem|Interviewee:  Hm... in my living group we uh we had a problem that the rent was getting too expensive because we didn’t have quite enough people living there but we still had a set amount of rent we had to pay as a group.  So the prices were going up to the point that people had to get kicked out.  So that was pretty rough  but this happened like a year ago.  So like one of my close friends was like I cant afford these prices  like there's just no way. And like then it dominoes  which was a huge problem.  |Interviewer:  Hm|Interviewee:  And a lot of people suggested a lot of different...a lot of different solutions.  Most of them were like motivated from anger.|Interviewer:  Hm|Interviewee:  So uh  some people were like everybody who moves out should have to pay and other people were like oh no if I'm if not living there I shouldn’t have to do anything so  so it was like pretty contentious.|Interviewer:  mm|Interviewee:  But  but we worked it out to a... it was like a variation of a plan that I suggested which was that we would uh  we would change the rent based on room size and how many people were living in the room.  So we'd allow people to have more space themselves and pay more  but people who would have otherwise been forced out could uh  could have other people crammed into a room and saved a lot of money.  So  so we kept some of the people we kicked out.|Interviewer:  Oh good.|Interviewee:  Yeah but it was pretty rough to get that motion passed.|Interviewer:  Mhm  so uh  can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to improve upon it.  |Interviewee:  Uh  I'm the opposite of type A so I can be pretty disorganized.  My lab notebooks like a lot of the time I make a lot of scribbles in at and when I write code the documentation like tends to be on the shaky side.  Um  so  so  it makes it kinda hard for other people to follow when doing ?  I never really thought it was a problem though until the most recent project that I've been on that I had to leave  uh  the project for a short amount of time and my partner like picked up where I left off and had no idea what was going on and I was like this is actually a problem the teachers like don't just tell you to document just to aggravate you.  So  I worked uh  so like since then like I've been working on like documenting what I do just like more diligently but also to check back up on it.  So that like there’s some kind of like review before like I show other people or before I let it out to a point that other people might rely on it.  So just to like read my documentation that and which I've never done before until this most recent project had that problem|Interviewer:  Well that's always a good practice.  |Interviewee:  Yeah|Interviewer:  So now  thinking about a job that you’d like to have  do you have one in mind?|Interviewee:  Sure  yeah|Interviewer:  So now  why should we hire you?|Interviewee:  Mostly because uh  results.  I'm  I just like get things done.  And there’s a like  there's a lot of things I know how to do  especially the job I'm thinking of is like a programming job like a startup.  My background  my degree is actually nuclear engineering.  SO  so like I don't have like the background the internships the stuff like that.  A lot of the coding interview questions they tend to ask I don't know  which is pretty rough  but uh I  I think that I would be  I should be hired because I would be resourceful and I'd do what it takes to get things done which is like working longer  being more resourceful  and stuff like that.  So like  I   I feel like I could get more results then somebody who has the same  or somebody who has a better background|Interviewer:  Ah  excellent.  Well thanks for coming today.,4.424642651201797,4.779917989142439
32,p5,Interviewer: So please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Myself  um  I'm a junior majoring in computer science at MIT I'm very interested in product design and not just how products are designed but how the business side of it how they affect the users and how he can use the technology to affect the masses.  I want to pursue (?) everyone.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: A time when I demonstrated leadership was  um  I was programs chair of the MIT Minority Business Association and it was my responsibility to plan our annual New York City Trip.  And  um  some of the challenges were bringing in sponsors and delegating tasks to all the members and managing people essentially.  And by  um  by delegating tasks according to interest and making sure that understanding people  what was going on in people's lives and helping them understand why we were able to complete a task on time  we were able to have a successful trip.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge.  How did you solve the problem.|Interviewee: Um  a time when I was working on a team was in my Elemental Sulfur? Construction class and I faced not people problems but a technical problem.  And it was a project in which we were trying to implement and the way we solved it was just by brainstorming and making sure we didn't deny anyone's idea off the bat  we just tried to be as creative as we could be.  And then we presented some of our solutions to a TA and through that we were able to solve the technical problem.|Interviewer: Tell me about one of your weaknesses.  What do you plan to do to overcome it?|Interviewee:  One of my weaknesses is actually I learned from my internship last summer is that usually when I work on a project or have an idea I wait until the idea is fully fleshed out or partially implemented before I share with others and get their opinion.  But it's  I find it's a better and more agile approach to share ideas as soon as possible and to integrate as quickly as possible.  So fail fast  essentially.  That what I would do to accomplish this in the future to seek opinion early on when I have an idea working on a project. |Interviewer: Now  why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Why I think you should hire me.  I think you should hire me because I'm very  I have a strong willingness to learn and I go beyond that and try to really get into why things are the way they are and why they work.  I break it down to small steps and try to build it back up to similar success.|Interviewer: Well  thank you.,5.367785494224581,5.133168375418295
34,p52,Interviewer: How are you?|Interviewee: Fine|Interviewer: So  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Uh  I’m Daniel. I’m a Freshman.|Interviewer: Hm|Interviewee: I’m from  uh  Fort Lauderdale  Florida. Thinking about course AN61 here. I  uh  actually  uh  I was here for running  but I realized it wasn’t me  so  um  I decided to drop early and am pursuing travelon. So  um  yeah  classes I am doing fine. Looking for a job now. That’s about it.|Interviewer:  Excellent. So  uh  tell me about a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Uh  I’d say  probably  I’d say rowing in high school was probably my best demonstration. I was  um  senior in my  in the junior varsity boat after some little qualms with sea-re-sing? I’d really  like  thought it showed them that  like  even though I wasn’t put in the best situation  like  I performed indiscriminately. And  I think  in a way I showed them that we would still be able to compete against a varsity eight and there was times where like we were always even  like  half the season we were always like around the same time. And  we ended up  uh  medaling at states. And I’d say that  um  a good part of that is by leading by example by the older  um  upper classmen  so I feel like maybe that was the point where I was demonstrating leadership.|Interviewer: Excellent. So  it sounds like you have worked on a lot of teams. Tell me about a time when you were working on a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?|Interviewee: Well  there was a lot of issues with my coach in in rowing. So um  if it wasn’t  I think  um I went through a lot of issues like that with my assistant coach at came for a year  and she helped me sort things a lot. She showed that I did have  um  proper technique. It was more of like  like a discriminating issue of my coach wanting certain people on the boat just because he thought it would move better. I realized that  um  as long as I kept on pursuing the sport  like  that’s all that really mattered. That’s all  like  my own efforts will fruit in something that will take me somewhere  that will help me get into MIT. So  I feel like  um  this  this like seeing things in my own way  right  and being distraught by other people effecting me helped. |Interviewer: Ah  that’s  uh  very good. So  uh  tell me about one of your weaknesses  and what you’ve done to overcome it.|Interviewee: I think one of my weaknesses has to be  um  the fact that  I’m a little  um  delinquent with my work. And  uh  um  I’m lazy at times. I definitely procrastinate. It was a pursuing thing through high school. And  uh  it’s still a little now because of a passing record. One of my combating is goal setting. I learned it from one of my  uh  from one of these  one of an upperclassmen that I know in  uh  at MIT. He  uh  told me  like  to write out  like  weekly goals and write out long term goals. Like  long terms goals meaning  like  the end of MIT  after MIT  what you want to do after the MIT experience  and short term goals  which is  like  get stuff done now. So  in a way that kind of put me things  put things in perspective for me. Realize that I shouldn’t be burning too much time messing around. By  I mean  certainly I should be messing around a little bit just because it’s  it’s a good time to have fun and relax. But  at the same time  I shouldn’t do it in excess. So  I guess that’s helped me a little bit. |Interviewer: That makes since. So  uh  uh  think about the job you’d like to have. Might be a rep or something else. Do you have something in mind? |Interviewee: Um  actually  yeah  um. I’ve never had lab experience before  so I really want a role  which is why-|Interviewer: O good  yeah  OK.. So now  why do you think we should give you this job?|Interviewee: Uh  well  for starters  um  I don’t have any experience  so I feel like  um  it’s a good place for me to start. And I’m really willing to do whatever it takes to make time for it. Um  I see how  um  I’m not taking too many classes this semester cuz I’m a course advantage. I’ll be making sure I’ll have enough time to make classes  uh  more manageable. I should be able to commit hours on it. I’m really interested in the job I’m doing  so  hopefully that interest will inspire me  uh  inspire me to work hard.|Interviewer: Ah  well  thank you for your time. I appreciate you coming in and interviewing today.,4.955792860625837,4.635006612255369
43,p61,Interviewer:  Tell me about yourself|Interviewee:  I am in aerospace and engineering  and a  |Junior  uhm I’m in naval ROTC  and I’m trying to be a naval  |Aviator.  |Interviewer:  Ready?  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee:  well with ROTC you get a lot of  |different opportunities each semester  uhm  depending  |On hold old you are  ah  you will be a squad leader  |Which is where you lead about 6 different people  ah  |now that I’m a jra I’m ah admino  which is basically  |where i do a lot of paper work and i help shape the  |background planning for the entire battalion.|Interviewer: mm wow ok tell me about a time when working on a team and facing a challenge  how did you solve that problem?||Interviewee: ah in unified last year  uhm we had the  |airplane challenge uhm and different people had  |different personalities some wanting and more  |controlling than others  ultimately we ended up ah  |dividing it for who had the better strengths ah and  |ultimately  we do really hope that the project was good |Interviewer: ok and can you tell me one of your weaknesses that hopefully will never come in?||Interviewee: One of my big weaknesses would be ah  |speeches in front of a lot of people||Interviewer: and what are you doing to overcome it?||Interviewee: well ROTC is kinda forcing me into  |positions to just practice all the time i feel that  |ultimately that will help||Interviewer: and why do you think we should hire you|Interviewee: (slight laugh)|Interviewer: (finishes sentence) in the meaning|Interviewee: ah because I'm physically qualified and  |trained very well and i feel my battalion has set me  |up to do well in the future||Interviewer: great,5.203658493617162,4.8958812751664675
44,p62,Interviewer: Ok. Alright  Ready to go?|Interviewee: Mmm  hmmm|Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: I’m good  |Interviewer: Good|Interviewee: How are you?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself|Interviewee: Umm  So my name is Juliann  ok  uhh  just hold up  so what  what exactly would this interview?|Interviewer: You can say background|Interviewee: Ok|Interviewer: It’s a behavioral  short behavioral interview for I guess for Med School|Interviewee: Ok  |Interviewer: Ok?|Interviewee: So I’m Juliann  I go to MIT  I’m currently a junior  I’m hoping to attend your  the medical school that I’m applying to  |Interviewer: Mmm  hmmm|Interviewee: Umm yeah I’m studying computer science and biology  which is a pretty new umm course here at MIT  and currently I’m taking mostly biology classes  I’m also doing research in the hematology lab  and umm  yeah so a little bit about myself umm I guess if you want to know a little bit about my background before college  I was born in Tai… I was born in California… in Irvine  umm and my parents and I moved back to Taiwan when I was about 10  so I went to International school there  umm but yeah  most of my friends were pretty bilingual. They spoke both English and Chinese so I would say that I’m pretty you know fluent at both languages. And yeah really look to both California and Taiwan as my homes.|Interviewer: Great  Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership?|Interviewee: Ok  umm let’s see… So I as I said I’m from Taiwan and I’m  I’m part of a student group here at MIT  called the association of Taiwanese students  and what I actually was  was a cultural chair uh  for a year  and one of our main events is to create a night market  so umm  yeah  so instead of you know the outdoors night markets that you see in cities in Asia  uhh we actually took it inside into our student center  so we had to work with umm the leadership from a bunch of different other clubs  so this included like the Chinese students club  umm  the association of  sorry the Asian American Association  as well some other umm cultural clubs in order to create this event  and so what my partner and I were in charge of was the food  and what we thought  we thought that this was you know  one of the umm biggest points of the event in the first place  so umm  yeah I think that you know ha… getting everyone umm as a group to really sit down and look at you know how much money we had to allocate here and how much umm  you know time everybody needed to set up  umm and we  yeah so my partner and I were in charge of that  and I thought that that was one time where we really showed our leadership and made something  umm  you know  arise out of that.|Interviewer: Great  and tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge  how did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: A team  umm  lets see  ok so over the summer umm  I actually  this last summer before my junior year  umm  I went to Taiwan and China. Taiwan and Hong Kong specifically to teach…|Interviewer: Mmm hmmm|Interviewee: And this was in groups of three  so there were two other MIT students and I umm teaching in a group…|Interviewer: Mmm hmmm|Interviewee: And so what this conflict arose  umm where we had two weeks of umm teaching and we weren’t sure because there were  there was also another group  another group of three teaching at the same time and we weren’t sure if the students really wanted us to like switch classes so that they could get umm more  more time with all of the six instructors  umm or if we just wanted to stick with the same grup of students for a complete two weeks…|Interviewer: Mmmm|Interviewee: And so you know kind of a conflict arose out of that umm it was pretty much you know  three versus three  like three of us wanted  we thought that it would be a good idea to switch and umm the other three thought that you know they wanted to have a more personal relationship with their students. And umm  yeah eventually what you know we we sat down at first it was pretty heated  umm  like so two of uhh  my colleagues  like one person from my team  and someone from the other  umm had you know really strong  strong ideas about umm what they wanted to do. So  you know what I said was  hey  everybody like let’s sit down and calm down  and you know think this through and talk it through  and you know I  I felt like I was one of the mediators in that  you know I didn’t let myself get you know too involved at first  and I didn’t let you know start screaming or anything like that  and I was really the one that said hey everybody sit down  umm  let’s talk this through  and so we really just you know calmly and logically thought it through  talked it through  and you know we were like oh what would be the advantages of of switching and what would be the disadvantages? And in the end we felt like umm the students were there to get breath and not necessarily depth  Since it was only two weeks anyway  and so we felt like it would be a lot better for them to umm have more exposure to all of the MIT instructors from all different backgrounds.|Interviewer: Ok. Ok  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you’re doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: Ok. I feel like one of my greatest weaknesses is uhh  self confidence. I  you know  I’m not naturally somebody who really wants to take a center stage to everything|Interviewer: Mmm hmm|Interviewee: Umm  and you know there are people  like some of my friends are very much so people who are in the center of attention a lot. And I think that that’s something that I have been working on and will strive to work on umm in the future as well.|Interviewer: Great. And why do you think you should get into this medical school?|Interviewee: Well I think that  you know  I (laughs) I I’ve demonstrated a lot of umm I have a lot of experience in the medical field  umm as a college student umm I do research in as I said in the hematology lab and I actually also work as an EMT. |Interviewer: Mmmmm|Interviewee: So that’s been a very  very large  big part of my life since umm last January. Umm  when I got my EMT  EMS umm license  and yeah so I actually work here at MIT umm as a Emergency Medical Technician  Uhh  I work probably 15 hours a week on that. Umm  but moreso beyond my experience I really have a passion for the medical field. Umm  and I you know want to see help both the research that I do that you know  hopefully  in the future uhh  some clinical  the clinical work that I do will effect medical field.,5.07918394889179,5.318850358975849
47,p65,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?|Interviewee: Yeah  pretty good. Um  don't feel particularly different from any other day.|Interviewer: [laughs] Uh  so  please tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Um  so I'm from Nearbell Fosten [SP]  Northern Ireland. I have three younger brothers  um  so  I think they have kind of influenced me as much as I probably have influenced them. Like  Mark  the next one down  he's only a year younger than me  so he was always a lot sportier. Uh  coming up through school he was always playing rugby and cricket and because of that  I got into those sports. Um  and then Ian  the next one down after him  is a lot more artsy and stuff  so I think because of his influence I'm kind of a bit more appreciative of things that I would have maybe just kind of  like  disregarded before. Um  Like  um  when we was down in New York there we went to MOMA and there was like  um  the Scream by Munch or Moonch . . .|Interviewer: Yeah.|Interviewee: . . . whatever  which was there  and some Van Gogh Starry Night and some lilies by Monet. So I [??] with that. But you know what? He will probably want to hear about this so I'll go and I'll take some photos for him. Um  and then Harry is the youngest one  he's kind of like just gets away with everything  being the youngest. But  um  should be pretty good to go back around Christmas and catch it with them and stuff. Um  probably not get back over to Cambridge in the UK over Christmas break but I try to keep in contact with friends from there  through like Facebook and stuff. Um  and yeah  just really enjoying my time here at the moment. That's a little bit of background on me and my family. |Interviewer: Uh  excellent. So tell me a time when you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Uh  so  this  I'm here on my third year  what you call junior year  my first two years in Cambridge I was part of like the Student Council for the college there while I was in college. So as part of that we do have like  we call it Thrashers Week  where as you kind of call it Freshman Rush  dorm exploration or whatever  um  so we had a big kind of end to that week  finale event that kind of took over college  like  multiple music stages and the legal drinking age in the UK is 18  so everyone at university could drink  so there were different promotions on different  um  bars all over the place in the college  different attractions and stuff. So  um  just kind of planning that  deciding what the theme would be  um  how we were going to decorate up the colours to tie in with that  and getting music acts  um  getting promotions on the main bar  and just making sure we were covered health and safety wise in terms of enough canisters  fire extinguisher points  emergency plans and obviously working as part of a committee on that and being responsible for individual sections  particularly  [??] being responsible for a particular area  I think that's quite a practical hands-on  time when I've been given leadership and I think I done well with it. |Interviewer: Uh  excellent. Sounds like a fun time. |Interviewee: It was  yeah.|Interviewer: So  uh  tell me about a time you worked in a team and you faced a challenge. How did you go about solving it?|Interviewee: Right. So  um  again going thinking back to Cambridge in the UK  um  we  one of the things that Cambridge is known quite well for is Rowing  so I got to Cambridge and I was like  ah  I've never tried rowing before  I'll take this up. So  um  in my first year there was me and a few of my friends took it up and we continued it into our second year  but one of friends then decided he didn't have time for it and just kin- kinda dropped it to the wayside  but we had the big kind of races that are towards the end of the summer there  they're called the Maybumps [SP]. And obviously any kind of sport team work is important  but in rowing so much of it is just getting in time with each other  working as one  and it takes like the whole year to build up this. So him deciding to [??]  was really going to be massively detrimental  'cause you can get someone to sub in and fill his seat but it's not the same. Um  so  convincing him to stay on  as part of the team and kind of rallying like getting a good  like  boat spirit  that we weren't just here guys that kind of rowed  but we all got along well and we actually wanted to row for each other. And because I had been given responsibility as Boat Captain  no like the overall boat club captain  but that boat. So  um  doing things like havin'  um  pre-race meetings together  and watching  like  video clips before  like kind of motivation Rocky style stuff. Um  and just making sure like we were training hard but people were enjoying training and it was the right kind of balance between  yeah we need to train at this level to be good  but we don't need to go absolutely overboard  and we can gauge when people just need time off  or need time to unwind or de-stress. Um  so kind of implementing that and it came round to the actual Bumps races  he hadn't quit and um  we managed to do a lot better than the previous term  previous term being a bit of a disaster  then this term we actually the best boat from the college. So that was pretty satisfying. Um  like  again it just kind of shows  like  the races are painful and tough but you work together to get through them  you feel good after. So that was like a pretty obvious sporting example of teamwork.    |Interviewer: So  tell me about one of your weaknesses and how you plan to overcome them. |Interviewee: Um  I think overall I'm quite  like  confident and happy to talk to people and stuff  but maybe a weakness could be that sometimes I do dive into things a little too eagerly  like  um  it could almost be that I could become better at these kind of interviews by just having the  that extra confidence to just sit there quietly for 20-30 seconds  think what the question actually specifically asked and answer it  rather than thinking  okay  they've stopped talking  I better start  and just diving in with an answer. And I'm coming across then as  perhaps  a bit frantic or not completely focused. So I think some of that is just going to be practice   like do interviews  get comfortable with sitting with a little bit of silence while I compose my thoughts and going into a well structured answer rather than just diving straight in with an answer as I've kind of been doing  I think  so far.  |Interviewer: [laugh] Um  Actually you've done surprisingly good so far. Uh  so now think of a job that you'd like to have. So why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  I think that obviously to hire someone they need to have the qualifications that are gonna allow them to do well in the job  but  like  almost any job  um  in today's world isn't going to be specifically tied down to one individuals sector. It's going to require skills that cross a variety of disciplines and I think that  like  I've used my university time so far in the UK and in America  really broadening the experience that I've got. Uh  broadening my  uh  ex- exposure to different fields of engineering.|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: And also using the really quite amusing house program you have here to broaden my exposure to even  like  artsy stuff. Um  I also think that through like projects  lab work  and things of that nature  I have the skills to work in a team. Be that  having the  uh  kind of humility to accept  okay  there's someone more experiences  more knowledgeable than me in this  I'll take the lead from them or I'll start realizing when it's an appropriate time I'll take the lead here because no one else is really going to  or I'm the best qualified to really take command.  |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: So  like  in terms of working with others  that's a strength that I have  um  and I think in terms of contributing to like  the overall atmosphere in the company  I'm quite a pleasant  optimistic person. I like to think that I'm someone that others would be happy to work around  so not only would I be working well  but others would be working well  um  through my being there. Um  I'm not saying like I'm going to suddenly make the company  like  200% more profitable  but I do think that I'll feedback in as much benefit as I'll get out of a job that I genuinely enjoy.|Interviewer: Well thanks for coming today.|Interviewee: OK. Thank you.,4.984282822367437,4.806065972565116
53,p71,Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Uh  I'm an MIT undergraduate junior studying mechanical engineering. And  I'm doing the flexible course which allows me to concentrate  um  in an area other than mechanical engineering. I chose building technology and I'm hoping to get a double minor in energy and architecture as well.|Interviewer: You're busy.|Interviewee: I'm sorry?|Interviewer: You're busy.|Interviewee: Yes.|Interviewer: Uh  tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership.|Interviewee: Um  I have taken on several leadership roles in my sorority. Um  one of the most recent roles was a CPW chair so  um  our university  uh  holds a weekend  uh  to invite prospective students who have been accepted but have not decided to come to MIT yet.|Interviewer: M'hmm.|Interviewee: And it's an important time to show them how great MIT is but also to give them a taste of different activities on campus. Um  so I organized a dinner at our house with a co-chair and then this year I'm planning all of our outer-social events. So there are basically three large  um  formal events... Um.|Interviewer: Tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: So in high school I was really involved on the robotics team. Um  there  I had  three other teammates. And it was very difficult to narrow down ideas  everyone had  like  different views  different opinions about how we should do things. Um  and I think that communication was the most important thing  making sure that like that we were putting our ideas on the table but also listening to each other. |Interviewer: M'hmm.|Interviewee: I thought that was one of the most important  um  factors in our success. We ended up doing pretty well as a group.|Interviewer: Good!|Interviewee: Yeah...|Interviewer: Can you tell me one of your weaknesses and what you are doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: One of my weaknesses is  kind of  um  going out of my comfort zone as far as what I'm studying. So I think that  uh  in high school because I was so involved in robotics I didn't really look outside of mechanical engineering. And then my parents are also architects  which is where that came from. So  there are two things that I'm really passionate about  but I feel that  especially being at MIT there are so many other areas I am kind of neglecting. Particularly the arts  I just don't really feel  um  I feel its important to have a bounds and not really achieving that right now.|Interviewer: Why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  I believe that I have a very strong educational background in the field. Um  I  I'm really passionate about the subject. It's something that I've been exposed to in the past because my parents are architects. Um  but  at the same time  I think it's something that I think is very important for the future  um  in terms of like energy consumption. Um  I wasn't sur... I knew I wanted to go into some sort of like energy field at MIT and I think I finally found one that I really enjoy. (Laughs)|Interviewer: Good!,5.157231190809987,4.826184933608249
54,p72,Interviewer: How are you doing today? |Interviewee: Uh  good  how are you?|Interviewer: Good! Tell me about yourself.|Interviewee: Um  uh  so I'm Rebecca. I'm a junior  uh  studying linguistics. Um  and I think I'm interested in doing linguistic research after undergrad.|Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. |Interviewee: Um  let's see  uh  so I did a  um  RA  I was an RA in my dorm  and we were in charge of leading the group of freshman  um  in advising them for academic reasons and  also in doing that- organizing events around the dorm  so I would occasionally be in the  uh  in the leadership position for that.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me about a time you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: Um  let's see  uh  for a linguistics project we had to do  I was working on  um  a team  or a group project. And-|Interviewer: Uh-huh.|Interviewee: And  uh  there was a problem. One of the members  uh  wasn't contributing their work on time |and so  we had to resolve that. So  um  we- the members who had been working together  uh  got together and we decided that call that person in and  just sort of discussed it with them and said that it was holding everyone back. And  uh  we were able to resolve it.|Interviewer: 'kay  tell me one of your weaknesses and what you're doing to overcome it.|Interviewee: Uh  one of my weaknesses would probably be shyness. Um  or fear of like talking in front of people  I guess. Um  but- so I've been doing more projects. A lot of times in linguistics we have to give presentations so  um  I've been doing more of that. And I actually  uh  volunteered to teach a splash class this fall  so that involves getting up in front of a lot of people and teaching something. And that was actually really fun  so I feel like doing things- that was sort of a way or- and I enjoyed what I was teaching about  so it seemed less intimidating. And I hope that doing things like that will get me over my fear of talking to people  so.|Interviewer: Great  and why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: Um  I think I have  uh  pretty strong credentials and  uh  doing well in my classes  and  um. I really enjoy research and linguistics. And I think I would  um  I think I work well with others and would be able to take on leadership roles if necessary. And  um  I think I would just have a lot to offer.|Interviewer: Great.,5.192098117206267,4.646391300375567
57,p76,Interviewer: So  how are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm doing well. Thanks.|Interviewer: Good. Tell me about yourself. |Interviewee: Well  I'm Zainab Lasisi|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: I'm a junior majoring in chemical engineering. I was originally born in Nigeria. Which is in West Africa. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: And I grew up in England and Jamaica before coming to MIT. |Interviewer: Great. Tell me about a time you demonstrated leadership. |Interviewee: A time I demonstrated leadership. I'd probably say  at the moment  um  in my position as the Vice President of the African Students Association at MIT. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm. |Interviewee: So as the vice president I have to be bas-  I have to basically support the president. And whenever the president of the association is not there step in. And actually be the leader for the association. |Interviewer: Mm. Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: So the African Student's Association is about an organization of  uhh  that consists of. That comprises of about 80 Africans at MIT. And  it's just all undergraduates. And it's all about just keep the African community alive. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: And just  so that people know that they have a support system. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: Within  uh  MIT. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm. |Interviewee: Cause most of them are  like  international students. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: So they're very far away from home. So it's like having a home away from home...|Interviewer: Yeah.|Interviewee: ...for them. Yeah.|Interviewer: Great. And tell me a time about when you were working on a team and faced a challenge. How did you solve that problem?|Interviewee: I'd probably say my past internship with BP. |Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: Um  I was working on a team. I was a process engineer intern. And the challenge I had was that I was given a project that  they didn't really know what. They hadn't  the project hadn't been done before. It's just something  like  they had ideas about what they wanted. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: But they had no clear cut visions...|Interviewer: Okay.|Interviewee: ...or anything. We just knew the  I guess  the skill set. And the types of things they want from my project. So for me  just to go about delivering a  a tool that's of use to the entire team. It is about working with people  communicating  asking them questions...|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: ...about what exactly it is they what me to do. And then doing. Then I did  like  a few modeling things. And then I'll show them and then they'll give me feedback  and then I'll do some more. So that was more about it cause I don't think they had an idea about what they wanted...|Interviewer: Right.|Interviewee: ...in the first place. They just knew  okay  we want this model to do this and do that  and do that. We're not too sure how it's going to do it  but  you know  just come up with some things. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: It was all on me to use my creativity and just pick people's brains and just come up with. Deliver something that's of use to the team. |Interviewer: Great. Can you tell me one of your weaknesses  and what you're doing to overcome it?|Interviewee: I think on of my weaknesses is that  um. I'd say I'm a very independent worker. So  sometimes...|Interviewer: Hmm.|Interviewee: ...I try  like  I don't  I-  I work too much by myself. Whereas in  I do work well in teams  but I just need to be more forth-. Because when I'm given a project I'm like  okay  I can do this. I'll just try to sort it out. So  I guess one of my weaknesses is  like  approaching other people...|Interviewer: Mm.|Interviewee: ...especially people that I'm not  I don't really know. And  like  asking them questions and things like that. So  yeah. Something I need to  to develop my communication skills a little better. So. |Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think we should hire you?|Interviewee: I think that  I am-. I have a wonderful personality. I'm great to work with. I will do anything that is asked of me...|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: ...with a smile on my face. I'll always try my best. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm. |Interviewee: And  I'll be a team player. |Interviewer: Okay.,4.76944260069407,4.690506717109329
71,pp11,Interviewer: So  tell me a little bit about your background.|Interviewee: Um so I am a student here at MIT. I'm a junior studying biology and management. Um  I am very interested in finance  specifically investment banking or consulting. Uh  I've taken a bunch of different management finance classes  as well as interned in business management... uh I've also done laboratory research and I'm working in a small consulting firm part time. As  as of now  so.|Interviewer: Ok. Thank you. Do you think you're a leader  and why?|Interviewee: Um  I think I'm a leader  I think I know how to command respect in certain situations. Um  I know how to work together on a team  I think that's very important  uh  especially in the positions that I'm working at I think working with a group of people  being able to encourage them  uh  to work towards a certain goal  uh  shows my leadership characteristics.|Interviewer: Ok. And  do you consider yourself a team player? And can you give me an example of a time there was a conflict in your team and you resolved it.|Interviewee: Um I defiantly consider myself a team player. I think a lot of the different internships and experiences I've had have forced me to work on a team. Um  specifically  uh  in the class that I'm taking right now  uh 5279 which is management communication  we are working on a team project together and we... when deciding on our topic uh for the team project  we had a lot of different disagreements  a lot of people had different ideas  uh and I think I kind of forced people to look at what they were saying  versus just like splurting out ideas  focusing on how their idea would actually turn out in a presentation. Um  and so trying to get people to compromise  um  and in the end we ended up picking my idea  so...|Interviewer: Great. Ok. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Uh  well  I think I'd like to be taller  that kind of thing (laughs) ... but other than that  uh  I think I wish I was more outgoing in certain situations. Um  I think sometimes I'm more reserved  or in class  I'm a little hesitant to participate if I'm not sure I'm a hundred percent correct. I think its kind of a MIT mentality  everyone likes to be right all the time. So I think  uh  I have less reser... er  if I had less reservations  about like  answering questions  that would be great.|Interviewer: Ok. And... why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: Um  I think with my academic experience  as well as my internship experiences I have enough uh  past um  data now assessing quantitative work as well as communication skills and leadership experience  um  and I have a nice balance of skills going into the position. And  I am a fast learner. I'm willing to learn on the job  so I think the combination of all that would be good.|Interviewer: Great,5.7414751839675855,5.3087130549268355
78,pp20,Interviewer: Tell me a little more about your life.|Interviewee: OK  um... this is separate from the other time  right?|Interviewer: Yes.|Interviewee: OK (laughs)  um  I'm a junior  um  at MIT studying environmental engineering. Um  I'm originally from Minnesota. Um  I'm taking classes this semester in hydrology and environmental transport and I found them really interesting. |Interviewer: Great|Interviewee: And I thought that they would apply to this job. |Interviewer: Mmmmhmm.|Interviewee: Um  yeah. (Laughs)|Interviewer: Great. So  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Um  yeah  I think I've stepped up to a lot of leaderslip  -ship positions since I came to college. I'm president of my living group  um   I'm also on the rowing team and I feel like I've  um  played a leadership role there  um...|Interviewer: OK. Could you be a little bit more specific?|Interviewee: Um  so  as president of my living group  um  I lead house meetings every other week |Interviewer: Oh  OK.|Interviewee: and I also am involved in resolving problems between people  um  so there's like several different conditions in the house which control  like  say for instance  like  buying food  or like  maintaining the house and I help coordinate everybody and make sure they can work together. |Interviewer: Right. OK. Do you consider yourself a team player?|Interviewee: Mmmhmm.|Interviewer: And can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Umm... yeah. Umm  let me think. I guess something that's come up in my living group  I was house manager last semester  and so  as part of our living group  people have to do  like  weekly house jobs...|Interviewer: Mmmhmm|Interviewee: So like  kind of chores  and so we've definitely had conflicts over  like  people who aren't pulling their weight in the house  and there were times I had to step in and take the person aside and let them know that they were adversely affecting the group and that there were  like  consequences if they didn't  um   end up  you know  pulling more weight  and I definitely had success with that and  um  one particular instance I talked to someone and she came back to the next house meeting and apologized to the group  and...|Interviewer: Oh|Interviewee: ... definitely started to change her behavior.|Interviewer: Oh  that's great. Ok  so  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Um... I don't... I don't think there's anything I would necessarily change about myself. I feel like the experiences I've had have  like  taught me different things...|Interviewer: Mmmhmm.|Interviewee: And  um  there's definitely things I'm working on growing in...|Interviewer: OK.|Interviewee: But they're things that  like  I don't think they're things I would expect to change overnight  necessarily.|Interviewer: Mmmhmm. Can you give me an idea of what those are?|Interviewee: Um  I'm working on being more outgoing  so  like I said  I've stepped up  both on the crew team and as part of my living group...|Interviewer: Mmmhmm.|Interviewee: ... into leadership roles  and so I think that's changed a lot in the last couple of years and is still changing. |Interviewer: Great. And... why do you think you should get this job?|Interviewee: Um  I think I have a lot of experience  um  with the classes I've taken and with previous internship opportunities. Um  I did an internship at an environment restoration company after my freshman year...|Interviewer: Mmmhmm.|Interviewee: ..which I think helped prepare me. Um  I'm also really excited about going into this field  um  I haven't  b-  had the chance to apply the things I've learned in my classes yet and I think this would be a really good opportunity for me to apply those things  so... I think I would be able to help the company out in that way.|Interviewer: Great!,5.0662419600798545,5.073438011178782
93,pp4,Interviewer: So please tell me about your background.|Interviewee: Sure  uh  my names Isaiah I'm an MIT student I am currently a junior in the department of aeronautics and astronautics.  um  and so I  I'm mainly focusing on the information systems behind uhh  aeronautics and  uhh  aeronautical and astronautical flight systems.  umm  my course work basically has included a fair amount of the basics of aeronautics and astronautics that's covered at MIT.  Uhh  in addition to that I've covered a lot of programming and programming work.  umm  both in and out of school  umm  so that has included  uhh  basically building a UAV from scratch  as well as umm  working on UAV programming for the department of defense  umm  which has  uhh  been done for collision avoidance for a lot of the UAV's now flying in the air.  |Interviewer: Do you think you're a leader? tell me why.|Interviewee: So  yeah  I do think I'm a leader  umm  so for example  uhh right now I'm actually holding several different leadership positions.  uhh  first of all I am the residential director for a group called [medlinks?] in my dorm  uhh  what we do is we provide students  uhh  health care support  basically.  uhh  we are authorized to give out over the counter medicines to other students  uhh  in our dorm  and as well  as well as elsewhere.  uhh we're certified first aid and some basic emergency care  and we're also there for  uhh  basically student health counseling  um  so  in my position as residential director  umm  I basically talk to the dorm executive board as well as the medlinks executive board  and uhh  we basically work together  I work as the Liason between the groups  um  and I basically help plan events  um  I work with them to resolve whatever issues are coming up  I [xx] meetings for them  umm  basically to help support basically the people who support our dorm.  umm  in addition to that  I kind of have like a quirky side leadership position which is umm as president of the MIT tapioca club  umm  we make and distribute large quantities of tapioca  so every once in a while  umm  we will  I will be organizing a whole bunch of students getting together maybe like a night or two of crazy cooking  umm  you know  ha ha|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Umm  sure  so  uhh  yes I do consider myself a team player  I've had to work in a whole bunch of different teams  for example  one time there was a bit of a conflict  umm  well it was basically when last year I was working on a  uhh  one of my assignments for an engineering class  uh  we had a problem  in which basically one of the students wouldn't show up  one of the other students  [xx] let me get this straight  one of the students had trouble showing up for basically the team meetings  and another one of them kind of basically got [xx] at that.  So the way I helped umm sort of resolve this conflict and basically bring everybody together to try to work out the project was I basically took it upon myself to help the person to figure out why the person who wasn't showing up wasn't showing up  umm  and I basically helped him work through some of the stuff that he had issues with  mainly he wasn't showing up mainly because he felt he didn't like wasn't able to contribute enough  didn't know enough about the programs we were working with  so I basically sat there and talked him through it  helped him basically develop some of the skills necessary to work with it  so in that way he basically showed up a lot more  he was much more productive and useful to the team  and that also um basically helped resolve the conflict we had in which we had you know we avoided losing a team member basically  and we avoided another problem of umm  basically  an annoyed team member having to deal with a person who he felt wasn't doing his job.|Interviewer: If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?  |Interviewee: Um  so this is actually something that I am actively working on  I feel that I should be more compassionate  um  this is actually something that um  so during my medlinks training  something that actually appeared  um  basically what we were doing  we were doing a bit of an exercise  um  in which we were presented with a couple of different cases  to basically  umm  illustrate  how it might be for a person to go through some very  very difficult  uh  I guess  difficult times or difficult trials  um  and so we were basic  we were given scenarios to imagine sort of  like umm  maybe the loss of a loved one or the loss of a secure place to be  uh  loss of some sort of  you know  a whole bunch of different losing things  and  um  I guess I wasn't  I wasn't as moved as other students were  primarily because I've been through all of the examples that they gave  so  I don't know  I guess on one hand that's a good thing on the other hand that's a bad thing  but umm  what that pointed out to me was that like I wasn't perhaps able to empathize as well as the others were  um  despite  I don't know  either despite  or specifically because  I had been through that  and um  part of the reason that I joined medlinks and am now currently actually trying to join the [MITEMS?]  umm  not because I want to pursue medicine as a career  but one  because I want to develop those skills  and two because I want to sort of develop and exercise more compassion.|Interviewer: Why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: Um  so I think I should get the job basically because of one  my past experiences  which have prepared me fairly well for the kind of employee that your looking for  a person with good strong aerospace and science background  as well as strong coding skills that are necessary for the umm basically kind of projects that I know you are working on.  additionally  I feel that I am a very reliable person  um  I have demonstrated that through my leadership positions  through the things that I have  initia-  um  sort of taken the initiative to engage in  such as the various programs I mentioned  and you know  the things I am trying to do right now  because of that I feel that I would be a valuable asset to your team.|Interviewer: Thank you  so I'm curious  what's the tapioca club? This is off the interview|Interviewee: It's what it sounds like.  We try to make it more than boba tea  umm  currently we have primarily made boba tea  so its like  I think we've done like two or three events  and basically every time its like ok I'm gonna go to china town  get like twenty to thirty pounds of tapioca  bring it back  and then like well spend like basically a night or two cooking  making large quantities of tea|Interviewer: We tried to sell boba tea here  it was not a profitable operation but it was a fun activity|Interviewee: I think what we're trying to do right now is kind of actually get enough funds to get a cup sealing machine  that way the club will be self sustainable  'cause like right now its MIT funded  but its so new that they won't give it consistent funding  we have to apply for new grants. so we're like  oh you know  we're paying MIT all this money to be here  why not make them give us money for food?|Interviewer: Fair enough  so thank you again for interviewing.,4.6484610490731875,4.3432703423414365
95,pp43,Interviewer: So uh  please tell me about your background. |Interviewee: Sure. So I am match-making computer science double major at MIT.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmmm|Interviewee: I worked in the product-tech and business space before umm doing both uh front end web development  for example  at Next Job and product management  for example  at Douche Ban  the German railway and Disney Parks and Resorts online.|Interviewer: Mmm-hmmm. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why. |Interviewee: Sure. I think I..I am. Umm one example of that is I'm the president of Baker House-it's a dorm at MIT.|Interviewer: Oh  yes. |Interviewee: Umm and as part of that I--there's about twenty members of the executive committee um and we run um events during the year- about a fifty thousand dollar budget. Um so making sure all of those run run smoothly um  that there aren't conflicts between members of the team  that the umm other business of Baker House gets done and gets done in an efficient way and a way that's good for the residents that are there.|Interviewer: Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time you faced a challenge while you were on a team and how you went about resolving it. |Interviewee: Sure  so this sem-or this past summer at Disney uh we had a challenge once with the time zones um and how they would be uh and how the app would be able to use time zones. So  we uh spent some time to got everyone on the phone together on a conference call and talked about umm what the app would have to do in order to support time zones. |Interviewer: Okay. Umm if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be? |Interviewee: Sure. I think the..the one thing that I um you know  maybe I..I...maybe it's..it's a false sort of sense of of what umm of something but at MIT it always seems like some people get the answers to some questions faster than I do and umm you know  it's it's probably just you know  their particular field that they are good in but you know some magical way of of you know  being able to do that would be good. |Interviewer: Well thank you. Umm so I guess my final question is think of that one job..|Interviewee: Uhh huh...|Interviewer: That you would like to have...|Interviewee: Yep..|Interviewer: Doing what? |Interviewee: Mmm-hmm |Interviewer: Good  okay. So  why do you think we should give you this job?|Interviewee: Absolutely. Umm you know  I think it's something that I've...I've certainly done before  something that I'm able to pick up quickly and uh really customize it you know  to this particular company umm and I think that's you know  there's there's few other candidates that have had this sort of graph of experience that I've had.|Interviewer: Ah  well thank you for coming. |Interviewee: Yep.|Interviewer: Appreciate you coming for the interview. |Interviewee: No problem. |Interviewer: Now uh...,5.166588237743541,5.108676053054941
96,pp44,Interviewer:  So  uh  please tell me about your background.  I’d like to I know a little bit about your background.  |Interviewee:  Sure  um  [clears throat] sorry.  Uh  I am a junior in Computer Science here at MIT.|Interviewer:  Mm-hm.|Interviewee:  I’m from [??]  Kentucky.  Uh  particularly interesting in  uh  consumer [??] products  um  front end development.  Um  I’ve had some experience doing both web development and some  uh  internal metrics testing and QA type of jobs.  So  that’s a little bit about my technical background.|Interviewer: Uh  thank you.  You think you’re a leader.  Tell me why.|Interviewee: I do think I’m a leader.  I think one of the biggest qualities a leader needs to have is dealing with people.|Interviewer:  Mm-hm.|Interviewee:  Uh  people skills are very important.  I’ve been involved in many situations that  uh  involve both conflict resolution with people  involve organizing people towards a certain  a certain purpose or goal  which I think is  uh  very important  uh  quality of being a leader.  For example  um  previous  uh  work  uh  I’ve done with one of [??] organizations on campus  called Camp [??] of MIT  uh  we had a committee that  my  myself and my co-coordinator had a committee which we  we used to organize the unions for campers and  um  newsletters for  uh  families.  Uh  to give you more context with that  uh  my job in that organization was to be a liaison between organization  which was a student camp  a student run camp for kids whose parents have or had had cancer –|Interviewer:  Mm.|Interviewee: - and being a liaison for the organization in the families who go to that camp.  So  that was my whole last year and I believe I was able to organize  uh  I believe pretty effectively.  Right now  I’m  uh  also a member of the MIT dance troupe  which  uh  is a dance group on campus.  And I’ve  uh  I’m choreog -   I’m a choreographer.  So  I’m organizing people there and definitely making sure we meet our deadlines on time for the big show that we hold every semester.  So  I think I can  uh  organize people pretty effectively and  uh  have a really good [??].|Interviewer:  Do you consider yourself a team player?  A team player.  Can you tell me a time when you were on a team and you faced a challenge  how did you go about resolving it?|Interviewee:  Sure  okay.  Um  I think  dealing with  doing these…  Let’s go with  so  uh  the same organization  Camp [??] organization  last year as the coordinator for the  uh  families.  A big challenge for us was  uh  organizing our data.  Um  so  how that  so  essentially  what I mean by that is each  uh  family had to apply  uh  with their camper’s applications  but the applications itself are pretty  pretty heavy and require a lot of information  doctor’s records  medical records  and so people would send in their applications at different parts –|Interviewer:  Hm.|Interviewee: - uh  during the year.  Um  so they would never usually send in a full application.  So  keeping track of that  um  proved to be pretty  pretty challenging in itself.  Um  there were about three of us that they would send different parts to  uh  and there were about ninety campers or about a hundred campers who ended up sending in documents.  So  uh  making sure that  uh  my team was communicating was important  very  very important.  In order to get through that –|Interviewer:  Mm.|Interviewee: - um  we decided to develop a  uh  sort of tool for  uh  organizing.  In the sense that – |Interviewer:  Hm.|Interviewee: - uh  whoever received that piece of the application would enter it in to this sort of database we decided to construct.|Interviewer:  Mm-hm.|Interviewee:  Uh  fill in the application and contact the family saying what they were missing and what they have turned in.  ‘Cause sometimes there was a little bit of a lasp [sic] in communication about who was to tell the parents about what they were missing and things of that nature.  Uh  I think it worked pretty well.  Uh  it was definitely a system which could be used in future years.  Um –|Interviewer:  Hmm.|Interviewee: - unfortunately  they switch to a different system  an online system  this year  so we don’t implement anymore.  That was a pretty solid system.  |Interviewer:  Well  that’s always good to hear.|Interviewee:  Yeah.|Interviewer:  Um  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee:  ‘K.  I think for me – |Interviewer:  Mm-hm.|Interviewee:  - um  wrist-taking.  Risk-taking is probably something I could  uh  work on.  Now  I don’t mean by risk-taking  taking risks just for the sake of risks  but being more open to  uh  trying something I’m not  uh  particularly  uh  familiar with or  uh  don’t know exactly what the outcome is going to be.  Uh  it’s definitely something I could  uh  give more thought towards.  I’m generally a conservative person when making decisions and trying to go with  um  solutions that I can definitely plan out and foresee  but I understand that  especially in the real world there are times when  uh  you just don’t know what’s going to happen with  uh  later down the line and decisions have to be made.  So  keeping that in mind  um  knowing when to take risk and definitely being more open to alternative ways of  uh  going down a certain path to a solution is something I could  uh  I’d  uh  I’d like to change about myself.  |Interviewer:  Mm.  Certainly true for many people.  So  uh  think about the job you’d like to have –|Interviewee:  Mm.|Interviewer: - why do you think you should get this job?|Interviewee:  So  uh  I think that the biggest  one of the biggest qualities in me  for me  is  uh  being able to  uh  being eager and able to learn very quickly.  I’m a very eager  um  to learn individual.  I’ve  uh  come into internships before not knowing much about the sort of technology and frameworks they use.  For example  this past summer  at my internship at this small company  uh  I had never used Ruby or many of the JavaScript frameworks they had used before  uh  and many of the testing frameworks.  And I just have to hit the ground running  but I think I have a very  uh  big enthusiasm for learning new things and it’s one of  uh  the greatest joys in the world to me is to  like  go in and just learn  uh  a new technology and put it into practice.  So  I think that  uh  what I may lack for in experience I more than make up for in  uh  very eager  um  to learn  uh  attitude and ability to pick up things pretty quickly in practice.|Interviewer:  Ah.  Well  thanks for sharing this all with me. |Interviewee:  No problem.  Thanks for having me.  |Interviewer:  Of course  it was great to meet -,4.9372978714778135,4.0420300671865785
99,pp48,Interviewer: So uh  please tell me about your background. |Interviewee: Uh  well  I go to MIT. I'm a senior right now. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: And I'll be graduating [??]|Interviewer: Uh-huh. Do you think you're a leader?|Interviewee: Yeah. |Interviewer: Tell me why.|Interviewee: Uh  to me a leader is somebody who takes initiative  and like creates a vision when they're given a blank slate. Uh  when  when I think somebody is a leader they  they don't have to be told what's done  or what needs to get done. And they form the infinite choices and possibilities can quickly pick up two or three  and make a decision. And also like get other people excited about it and organized.|Interviewer: Very good. Uh  do you think you're a team player? Give me an example of a time you were on a team  and you faced a challenge. How did you overcome that?|Interviewee: Hum  Oh yeah. Obviously I do think I'm a team player. I'm trying to think of an example. One specific challenge. The uh  for the [??] project you do as a senior. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: We had to ah  my group was in charge of analysing the materials  and we  of the section that I got asigned was  was ah  within our team we did like a self ah  splitting it up. And I got like a way way heavy load  and somebodies got to really like move. So it was like pretty  I didn't know if I should talk to somebody else about it or something like that. And I decided like if we were going to do it as a team. Then we're going to have to be on the same page. So at some of my meeting we made sure to split it up a little more evenly. |Interviewer: That's very good. So uh  if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee: To never have to sleep. Like realistically? Is this like ah...|Interviewer: Yeah something  something that you need to improve upon. I vote to not being able to sleep as well  but unfortunately...|Interviewee: Not going to answer things like that. |Interviewer: Uh  I would like to teleport as well  but uh...|Interviewee: Uh  definitely to be more organized. So a lot of time I'll get like  my notes will get messy  and stuff like that. Organization. I've been working on it  but it's not where it needs to be.|Interviewer: Very good. That's a problem that afflicts us all. |Interviewee: Yeah.|Interviewer: Uh  so do you have a job you'd like to have? Do you have in mind?|Interviewee: I do.|Interviewer: Okay. So can you tell us why you deserve this job?|Interviewee: Uh  cause I work well with other groups  and this job requires like small groups to work together to accomplish things. |Interviewer: Uh-huh. |Interviewee: And a small group is like the perfect environment for me to do work that is collaborative  but it's not like bureaucratic. |Interviewer: Hum. |Interviewee: So  so this is like the perfect environment  and uh  and I have like some experience in the area. But more importantly like I  I figure things out and get them done. Like as they need to be  so people don't have to tell me what to do  or watch over me and stuff like that. Like it's  if I want something to be accomplished like we'll work with a team to get it done. Without like somebody telling you or watching you whatever. |Interviewer: Oh well thank you. I appreciate you coming here today for this interview.|Interviewee: Yup.,4.751343924740224,4.298515119837956
101,pp5,Interviewer: So  please tell me about your background.|Interviewee: Alright so  my background  I'm a junior at MIT studying computer science and  umm  I've also done research in the computer science field. Umm  I interned  er  I researched with a group at MIT and what we did was we made an interactive game to  uh  to teach. And I've also had some experience  uh  internship at  uh  at Google.|Interviewer: Oh  that's all very cool. Thank you. So  uh  do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: I think I'm a leader. I do believe I have leadership  uh  qualities and that  and I can support this because I've been in leadership positions in organizations here on campus. And when I have had the responsibilities I've carried them out  uh  very well and I've been able to overcome challenges such as umm  one of the groups I'm  uh  on the executive board of expedited access to standard education. Umm one of the our tasks this semester was to come up with an idea for a presentation and to carry it out at a control show from another group. And I took complete ownership of that and it came out pretty well and we were able to raise more money than we have in the past.|Interviewer: Ah  that's excellent. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Oh  well I definitely would consider myself a team player and an example would be from uh  my participation in my team in are student association|Interviewer: Mhmm.|Interviewee: And for one of the tasks where we were trying to accomplish  I was in charge and I thought I'd give some tasks to other members and a lot of tasks were not getting completed by the deadline that I set  so  um  as leader to be responsible for that task  I tried to figure out what was going on in the other students' lives because I was getting context and uh  understanding why they were missing deadlines when we didn't have a lot of tests or homework that week. And through that  ahem  through that understanding I was able to  um  help motivate them to complete the tasks and resolve that conflict.|Interviewer: Ah  that's all very good. Uh  if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be?|Interviewee: One thing about myself. Interesting. If I was given the option to change one thing about myself  yes?|Interviewer: Mhmm. Yes.|Interviewee: What I would change is to  uh  I guess  uh  just generally have a lot more knowledge in my field than I  than a person at my level would  you know  at this kind of level  and that's umm  that's something that would be nice. You know I feel like I would be able to be uh  much further along in my career than I am now.|Interviewer: There's always more that we can learn.|Interviewee: Uh huh  yeah.|Interviewer: Why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: Well I think I should get the job because I  um  have the skills necessary to complete the  the task that I'll be assigned. Um I'm very motivated  I'm always willing to learn and I  I'm very passionate about learning and uh  I think I'll be able to learn a lot through the position  as well as contribute to the position and be able to  um  influence the people that I work directly with or that are shareholders in my project.|Interviewer: Well thank you!,6.015315108421804,5.339439817540609
103,pp52,Interviewer:  Please tell me a bit about your background.|Interviewee: Um  well Im from Florida.  I was born in Miami.  My  uh  parents are from...I'm  uh  South Korean by ethnicity.  I'd say I'm more American by heritage but uh  my  um  parents came around here in the 80s and they settled down.  And around  I was born  like around 90s I was born here in Florida.  I had all my schooling in Florida.  I went to home school until 7th grade then private school until I graduated.  That's a brief synopsis of my background.|Interviewer: Okay.  Welcome.  So  uh  do you think you're a leader.  Tell me why.|Interviewee: I think I am  uh  just because  um  I have seniority maybe through sports or if it's from...I feel like it's hard for people not to be leaders especially when you're um  assigned to do group work or you're assigned to do goal setting.  I feel like if you're in any  uh  situation where you're doing goal setting you're being a leader by putting out what tasks you should do and how to execute them.  And how you tell  like  you're telling yourself  How am I gonna get this done.  So like  basically you're self leading.  I believe.  Um  maybe I'd say through sports I was probably a leader.  By  um  me being the upperclassman  I led my teammates on.  So I'd say  yeah  I've been a leader.|Interviewer: Very good.  Do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a conflict that you experienced on a team and how you resolved it?|Interviewee:  Uh  yes  um.  SO  seeing how I rowed four years  I think the biggest conflict was um  when  um  Junior year I was rowing for Junior Eight for nationals where we were in the grand finals.  ANd the last  pentameter of the terameter (sp) race my oar popped out and we ended up actually going from third place to dead last in the grand finals. That was possibly the most hard experience because it made me really reevaluate what it meant for me to be rowing  especially because that's something I spent four hours a day  six days a week on for my entire senior  um  high school career and that twas something I was going to carry over through to college.  And what really um  made me realize was that yes  like  that was a big mistake  it was just  honestly it could have happened to anyone but if it weren't for some people  if it weren't for just me  just being  just taking and it and just maturing from it  I think that's like  what it takes.  If you go through something really bad but you can get stronger from it.  You can still push something onto the table.  Like  um  last  last (?) year and still work hard to  to really fight through it.  You can really become great.  And um  I feel like that's what I was really working to change my view on that and um  in the end we  um  we medaled  we  uh  were runner ups in states.  We medaled.  So  I think that was a  good  good conflict that I resolved.|Interviewer: Good.  I imagine that would have been a very difficult situation.  |Interviewer: It was pretty tough.|Interviewer: If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would that be?|Interviewee: I wish  I wish...If I could change one thing about myself I think it would be me being  I think  more proactive to do something.  I'd say  I wish I was more...I wish I was could  I wish I was a little bit more volatile in things I chose  actually.  Because I feel like um  I stuck to just doing crew in high school and I thought that was great but I was wondering  like  I wondered what would happen to me if I tried different  more than one thing.  I know  I know like it's good for people to stick just to one thing and just grow in that field.  But I always wondered  I always wondered like  what would happen if I pursued more toward research or more towards um  club activities.  That way I could have like  a more well-rounded high school experience.|Interviewer:  So  now thinking about a job you'd like to have.  Okay  you have one in mind?|Interviewee: One right now or just...|Interviewer: The one you interview for.  So  why do you think you should have this job?|Interviewee: Well  I think I should have this job mainly because I find that I'm well with groups  I work very well with groups.  At the same time when you push me to do tasks myself I'm able to do the same amount  be just as productive.  I feel like  um  as an applicant being subject to group work and individual work  um  there should be no difference in how I should produce something in group work in individual work.  I should be just as creative and innovative if I was working myself or if I was spending time working with a group of people.  So  I feel like if I was going to get this job  um  it would help greatly for the people I'd be working with and for myself.  |Interviewer: Well thank you.

112,pp61,Interviewer: So how are you doing today?|Interviewee: I’m doing well  thank you.|Interviewer: Good. Umm  tell me more about your background. We never met before.|Interviewee: “Laughs” O ok. Umm. My name is Victoria Mcray (sp) and I’m an Aerospace Engineer at MIT. I am a Junior and I’m in NRTC (sp) witch is a Naval training program that you take during college to commission as an officer. |Interviewer: Alright. Umm. Do you think you’re a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: I would say I am a leader in training at this moment. Umm through ROTC I am put in leadership rolls reach semester. Which help  ahh  build the skills towards becoming a leader. |Interviewer: “quite white noise” Great. And do you consider yourself a team player. Can you give me an example when there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Umm  last semester I was a squad leader in ROTC…|Interviewer: umm’hua|Interviewee: … which is where you lead about “coughs” six to eight people  umm  and you all have to work as a unit to earn  ahh  honor squad at the end of semester. |Interviewer: umm’hua|Interviewee: Which is dependent on upon  umm  our PT scores which we have competitive… PT being Physical Training  umm…|Interviewer: umm’hua|Interviewee: …we have different physical competitions each week. We also have  Naval Knowledge quizzes  etcetera  in working together. Umm  and we had  sometimes  the freshman are a little  umm  getting use to it a little slower  in to getting to the…|Interviewer: umm’hua|Interviewee: …swing of things. Umm  and  we have this one who is having issues with PT  so I helped have extra sessions  to help  umm  do more physical fitness and…|Interviewer: umm’hua|Interviewee: …ended up doing a lot better towards the end.| |Interviewer: O that’s great. Ok. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: My command presence. Meaning  umm  sometimes I’m more quite  and its something I think it over and not be as shy about when I talk to others and to feel confident when I know something. Umm  in order to fix this I often put myself out there and try and “coughs” not hide in the corner. |Interviewer: Great. And… why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: “laughs” umm  I’ve wanted to be a naval fighter pilot for a very  very long time and I have been taking steps to go beyond  umm. I’m going to be taking ground school next semester  and aerospace engineering  umm  and I’ve gone flying a few times  and I think that through ROTC and my own experiences I will be a good candidate for a fighter pilot in the Navy.,5.018624581474821,4.901600815460544
113,pp62,Interviewer: So how are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm good.|Interviewer: Tell me more about your background.|Interviewee: Okay so I was born in Irvine  California  um where I lived for about ten years. And um my parents and I actually moved back to Taiwan um at that point. So I went to an international school there. Um. It was mostly English speaking  but outside of school I would often speak Mandarin also with a couple of friends  um  as well as  you know  just getting by in the outside world.|Interviewer: Right.|Interviewee: Yeah  and so  yeah  so when I was after high school  I decided to apply to colleges in the U.S. Um just because I was more interested in living here and working here in the future.|Interviewer: Mmmhmm.|Interviewee: So  yep  applied to a couple of different schools. Um. Choosing  ending up choosing MIT.|Interviewer: Okay. Do you think you are a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: Um I would say that in terms of leadership style I would not consider myself a like a born leader. Um that said  I do think that I am um my leadership style comes mostly from mediating things. Um I tend to be very you know I am really good at stepping back um and looking at a situation um as a big picture. I think using that while I don't necessarily you know take the center stage all the time and you know and stand up and you know order people around or anything like that. In that respect  I feel like I can I can usually end up managing um different groups of people very well in a very um mediatory kind of manner.|Interviewer: Okay. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me a example of a time where there was a conflict in your team and you had to solve it? |Interviewee: Absolutely  yeah  I definitely do consider myself a team player. And um an example I can tell you about is I actually work as an EMT um so an Emergency Medical Technician here on campus. And we have different um ranks within our crew so currently I am a second rider which means that there's there's usually somebody above me and as well as somebody below me in a single crew. And so one case was we were dispatched to a patient who had chest pains. And so we didn't know anything about this patient until we got there. Um. But when we did  um mostly the crew chief  the person above me  and I were discussing you know what could potentially be the underlying problem. And you know we kind of disagreed on that initially um because my crew chief um talked about mentioned that you know it could be a cardio problem.|Um. But I think  whereas um I didn't necessarily think it was that. And so you know we took a couple of minutes just to stand back and kind of you know   consider all of the possibilities. And um we ended up having to ask the patient like a couple of other questions. Um. And what we ultimately found out was that he had a history of anxiety.|Interviewer: Oh. Okay.|Interviewee: So that um I think was was the was the root cause of the problem. And um I think that that was something that you know was something very important because um to to the care of the patient as we went down the line.|Interviewer: Great. If you had the option to change on thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: Um. If I had the option to change one thing about myself. Um. I think that I would definitely choose to make myself more confident. Um. Mostly as a speaker  I tend to be I tend to get um pretty nervous as yeah when I have to speak in front of large groups of people. Um and I have worked on that. Um. Both as an EMT  you know  you have to really work on your confidence so that you know your patients trust you a little bit more. Um and also as leaders of different groups on campus. Um such as I'm leader of MIT Met Life as well as the Association of Taiwanese Students. So you know in the various uh clubs and groups that I am involved in across campus  I've definitely had to I've definitely been using those opportunities to work on um you know giving myself opportunities to speak onstage in front of large groups of people.|Yeah and I think that ultimately that would help a great deal as for me as a doctor in the future.|Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think you should get into medical school?|Interviewee: Okay. There are a couple of reasons I think I should get into medical school. Number one  I have a great deal of experience um in clinical fields as well as research. I work in a hematology lab here on campus. Um. I've been working here for about a year already. Um and yeah I really really enjoy the process of you know going through the scientific investigation process as well as you know it gives you a lot of a lot of joy when you figure out..|Interviewer: Right.|Interviewee: Um. Whether or not something works. And um so I mentioned before also that I work as an EMT so I so beyond having the scientific background  I also have a little bit of clinical background.|Interviewer: Mmhmm.|Interviewee: Um. You know being able to manage patients and to talk to them. And I think that's that's you know  a crucial component of being a doctor as well. But lastly I have a great deal of passion for the medical field. And um I hope that what I what I ultimately learn in medical school will give me I think the you know the opportunity to make a great difference in the medical field.,5.028415029014902,5.0845572093751485
116,pp65,Interviewer: tell me about your background.|Interviewee: Um so I'm obviously not from the States as the accent gives away. I'm from a smallish town called Carifargus near Belfast in Northern Ireland. I just went to a local primary school there which is the equivalent of elementary school um for people this side of the pond. Uh and then like a local high school and uh was encouraged to within a year to consider applying to Cambridge which was something I hadn't really thought was something appropiate for me. I kind of just envisaged going to one of the Northern Irish universities maybe one of the Scottish ones. Um so I applied to Cambridge and luckily they seemed to think that I was suitable. So I've spent the last two years um there studying engineering. And then the opportunity came up to spend my junior year here in the States. So I went for that immediately. Um I've been moving into specialism of aerospace engineering |Interviewer: Mm-hm.|Inerviewee: Uh just because I've always been interested in space and um it would be quite uh like a personal ambition to be somehow involved in future space exploration um in terms of actually like desigining the stuff and helping to actually deliver it. Um so ideally that's where I see my kind of professional career path going. Uh aside from that stuff I'm quite into sport. Like I have three younger brothers so we'd often play sports together. Particularly rugby cricket um soccer. Uh but I have got into the American ones since being here. Um basketball um it's probably the one that was least aware of before I got here but I've managed to get tickets for a Celtics Timberwolves game tomorrow.|Interviewer: [laughter]|Interviewee: That should be good fun. And was as Fenway Park I think in my second week here or something.|Interviewer: Oh...|Interviewee: A Red Sox game so... Immersing myself in the American culture. Definitely enjoying my time here.|Interviewer: Well good. Glad to hear you're uh getting to enjoy the city. So uh do you think you're a leader? Can you tell me why?|Interviewee: Um yes I think that I have the self-confidence to be a leader. I'm someone who's happy enough to stand in front of others and put their kind of head on the block as the saying is make a decision and accept that if it does go terrible the consequences will come back and I can't just pass the blame on. Uh I think this is self-evident in positions I've held so far in my univeristy time in the UK where I was on the student council for my college Robinson College in Cambridge for both my freshmen and sophomore years. Um two different positions but both of them elected and competative elections. Obviously my peers think that I'm uh suitable leadership material.|Interviewer: Mm-hm|Interviewee: Um how does that allude to you from previous response sports is another big part of my life. And in that I've had um competency rules with school's rugby and then college rugby and also college ruin. Um so I feel I have the experience of leader of having been a leader before and I have the confidence to lead others while also realizing at the same time that there will be others in the group that have strengths that I don't have. So um I'm humble enough to realize that and and hopefully get the best out of others by not insisting that the way that I've initially thought to approach the problem is the only solution. You can be a leader a very good leader by listening to suggestions that others have and being able to discern which are implementable and which are merely to put on the let's leave that for now pile. So yeah I would feel that I'm a good leader.|Interviewer: Well good. So um do you consider yourself to be a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when you worked in a team and encountered some sort of a challenge? How did you go about resolving it?|Interviewee: Yeah so the obvious examples here would be sporting achievements and stuff but I think and just out of a variety a good antitote for growth um in the UK we still have a monarchy one of the few countries that do.|Interviewer: Mm-hm.|Interviewee: And the queen's husband rather than being king is the Duke of Edinburgh. I'm not sure why he doesn't get to be a king but anyway so there's a scheme called Duke of Edinburgh's Award which is aimed at 16 17 18 year olds. And there are three tiers too bronze silver and gold. So I've completed all of them. I have the set of the gold. And in order to do this a big part of it that people that undertake this scheme that they raise is the expedition element. Um you go somewhere you haven't been before with coordinates certainly maps compass tents troungier and enough food and supplies for like four days. Um you follow a predetermined route but obviously you have to uh like deal with unexpected realities. If there's flooding and suddenly a path is no longer a viable transport option you got to reroute yourself around that. If I come too exposed and there are high winds you need to decide for a different sleeping point for that night. We did our gold expedition in the summers in the final years of my high school. We traveled to which is a very nice area naturally. We spent three days four night hiking really glorious weather. One big mission. When we encountered another group they were lost. quite hysterical. They thought they will never be found. We made a decision we would make a detour from our way to get these other hikers in the nearest area so that they can then contact the other hikers they knew in that area. and pretty much get themselves back in to familiar surroundings calm them down make sure they are okay and go on to our planned destination. To be honest I did quite enjoyed that experience. getting to feel slightly like a hero. That was a time when we had to work as a team. One of us could not have dealt with all by themselves because they were five hysterical people with all their backpacks and equipments. They were tired. They weren’t feeling like carrying any more we had to distribute their load among ourselves and make sure we do not lose them on our way from where we found them to where we ultimately drop them off in the nearest village. The whole expedition is a big example of team work. keeping each other motivated keep going at the pace of the slowest individual so that no one is left behind . encouraging each other so that the slowest individual is not on the ground . It was massively enjoyable experience. That would have been one major team work experience|Interviewer: not to mention. If I give you an option to change one thing about yourself what would that be ?|Interviewee: I think umm the one thing that really seems to set me aside between me and a lot of friends and my brothers that I could probably benefit from caring a little more about my outward appearance. Not that I think I dress very scruffly or anything but I don’t really mind leaving the house in the morning with my hair soaking shower and wearing jeans and t-shirt. two out of three of my brothers worry about straighten hair which I wouldn’t agree at all. but if I cared little more just making sure my hair is not messy when I leave the house that would probably be small benefit. given that even though there is a saying don’t judge by covers people inevitably make decisions as soon as they see you. and they can’t perhaps if I was a bit more self conscious about my appearance that would be something of a benefit|Interviewer: Think of a job you would like to have. Why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: I think this is the kind of job in which job satisfaction can be the greatest benefit if it is something that is genuinely interesting to you. And as I said before I have such a deep rooted interest in space exploration just really pushing the limits of what we can achieve. I feel that this kind of job is what I will just get up in the mornings really thrilled get into work and do my parts towards contributing towards it. umm I realize it’s also the kind of job where projects are really so vast ranging there is gonna be inevitable variety and also this would scare me I would be really drawn I get to challenge myself in various different ways novel situations that I perhaps haven’t encountered before with the opportunity to work with other professionals who are equally umm well established within the field that you are really getting to work with the best and that can only help improve me as a professional and as a business person. and it’s um yeah other things such as inevitable prestige and umm the financial benefit just the job satisfaction . I can easily see this something that will interest keep me coming back for work for the length of my career. That would be the key reason. um I think I would just be able to enjoy the work and therefore put my best and get the best out of my and ultimately give the company the best chance to success.|Interviewer: Thank you for interviewing with us today.|Interviewee: thanks for letting me come out. umm It turned out okay. I think it was a group of case female. 17 to 18 years age range. we opened nearby village public and get to a public phone. our school was quite strict. didn’t allow us to bring mobile phone. which was probably a good thing.,4.909249077289392,4.129772629040855
122,pp71,Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm good  how are you?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me more about your background.|Interviewee: So I'm studying mechanical engineering at MIT  and I am taking the flexible course which lets me concentrate on a subject other than mechanical engineering...|Interviewer: Hmmm.|Interviewee: ...and I've chosen to concentrate on building technology. And on top of that  um I'm double minoring in energy and architecture to supplement my concentration. And I'd say two years ago  two summers ago sorry  I interned at Square One Armoring Services  which is a company that manufactures armored vehicles for the government. And I interned with them for two summers  and this was before I really chose the building technology route. I didn't really like the super mechy side of it. This past summer I interned in Barcelona  um  with a company called Ilon(?)  they're a very large engineering consulting firm and I worked in their architecture department. And I really enjoyed the experience. So  I'm going that direction.|Interviewer: Ahh. Ok. Do you think you're a leader? And tell me why.|Interviewee: I believe I am a leader. Um  I normally  I wouldn't necessarily run for positions  but when it comes down to someone filling the spot  I will step up  um  and make sure that things get done. I feel that I might be more of a...of an encourager  so to speak...I don't really like sliding my ideas down the table and making everyone follow it but I try  sort of to like  to lead people in the direction that I want to go to and to integrate their input with mine.|Interviewer: Ok. And  do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of a time when there was a conflict on your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee: Um  so I uh  had a coach here this past year to plan the campus preview weekend dinner  um at my sorority. Its a weekend where MIT pre-freshmen come on campus to see if they like the feeling from MIT and its a big recruiting event for a lot of different groups around campus. And um  so my coach and I had very different ideas at times about what we wanted to do and how to go about doing it  but I feel that communication was defiantly the most important factor in sort of getting through those difficulties and working together as a team and we wound up having a really successful event. Um  a lot of the girls that came to the dinner  um  who are now freshmen  still say  Oh I remember you from (unintelligible). It was a really good feeling to get through that.|Interviewer: Ah  good. If you were given the option to change one thing about yourself what would it be?|Interviewee: Um  I'd probably change trying to be a perfectionist. Um  I like doing things right and sometimes its not the most time efficient or energy efficient way of getting about things. Um  I think thats something  to sort of  a strange thing to work on  to let things be sometimes  heh.|Interviewer: Ok. Why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: I think I'm qualified for this position academically  and I've taken a lot of courses that apply to building technology. And my intern experience as well. I'm really interested in the subject matter  and my parents are architects  so I've sort of had this my whole life and I've always kind of denied my interest in architecture because everyone always pushed me towards it  but now I do realize that this is something I truly enjoy. And sort of mixing it in with my other more technical interests  um  I feel bring me further in the field.,5.076557306461201,5.202498607635153
123,pp72,Interviewer:  How are you doing today?|Interviewee:  Good  how are you?|Interviewer:  Good.  Tell me a little bit more about your background.|Interviewee:  Um.  OK  so I'm a third year linguistics student  umm  I'm  uhh  working on some linguistics research right now and I'm interested in going into linguistics research after undergrad.|Interviewer:  Do you think you're a leader?  Tell me why.|Interviewee:  Um.  Yea I think I'm uhh leader.  I think I've fulfilled leadership positions in the past and umm I think I've excelled in that role umm.  I've led different group projects in my classes and I've also been umm a resident associate advisor in my dorm umm  and I've led activities there where we had to organize events for freshmen once a month uhh to get them interested in different aspects of the curriculum and also umm just general helping them out for things  so.|Interviewer:  OK  and do you consider yourself a team player?  Can you give me an example of a time where there was conflict in your team and you had to resolve it?|Interviewee:  OK  umm  so yea I think I work well as a team member  umm  for a big group project we had in one of my linguistics classes  umm  we had to look at aspects of a language and so we were broken into groups of four  umm  and we were each split to look into different aspect of the language so two people looked at the phonology  or the sounds of the system  and my partner and I looked at the grammar of the language  and so one of the two people assigned to the phonology group wasn't really following through with his part of the work  umm.  He  I guess he was busy with other classes but his partner was really stressed out about it so she came and talked to my partner and I and asked what she should do about it  cause he wasn't helping out.  And so  the three of us sort of talked about it  and then we emailed him asked if he could come meet with all of us. The four of us were able to talk about it and work out an agreement where he did some of the...some extra work in putting the two parts together  the phonology and the syntax  to make up for the fact that he hadn't done as much for the original research.  So  that ended up working out well  so.|Interviewer:  OK  good.  And if you were given an option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee:  Um  I think it would...probably be my shyness because that tends to hold me back.  Um  but I think I've been working to change that.  Um  I've been trying to practice things umm like presentations that make me nervous or that I have problems with because I'm shy.  I've also been trying to get out and meet more people. I've been doing more extracurriculars. And  umm  I volunteered to teach a class to middle schoolers and high schoolers  so  that sort of helped in a low stress environment practising presenting.|Interviewer:  And  why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee:  Um  I think I would be a really good addition to a linguistics research team  because I'm really really passionate about linguistics and it's something I really enjoy spending lots of time working on.  Um  and I enjoy working on a team and I work well with other people.  And I've had research positions in the past and I think I would umm be a good addition to a team.,5.311087502366477,4.846788931746056
126,pp76,Interviewer: How are you doing today?|Interviewee: I'm doing well  thanks. And yourself?|Interviewer: Good. Tell me more about yourself.|Interviewee: Well  I'm Zaynab. I am a junior in chemical-- majored in chemical engineering at MIT  but I'm doing a minor in energy studies and a fo-- a concentration in anthropology.|Interviewer: Okay. Do you think you're a leader? Tell me why.|Interviewee: I think that I am a leader. This is because I've held various leadership positions at college thus far  and I think with my leadership  the groups and the organizations that I've been part of have been able to succeed. For instance  at the moment  I'm the vice president of the African Students Association and the MIT African Students Association as well  a group of 80 students  both international and domestic students.|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: So  we're more of a social group  where we throw social events  such as like  cultural shows and study breaks  and things like that  just to get the African students ignited and just united so that they can confront each with whatever problems they have.|Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: So I guess the most recent event that we had was a cultural show  where we displayed to the entire MIT community just about what it's like to be African like  through-- we did it through performances such as like dancing  singing  spoken word and things like that. And also  other schools from the Boston/Cambridge area like Harvard  Boston University  Wellesley  and so on  they also came  attendance and that was fun.|Interviewer: That sounds great. Do you consider yourself a team player? Can you give me an example of where there was a conflict in your team and you had to resolve it.|Interviewee: I think the time  like  when there was a conflict in my team was  when I was doing this project for one of my classes  which was in my sophomore year. So  there was  like  a group of four of us and we all divided the topic evenly so that we could all focus on a specific part of the project. |Interviewer: Mm-hmm.|Interviewee: However  there was one person that just wasn't pulling her weight. So  I wasn't too sure whether it was just she's stressed or busy with other things  like towards the end of the semester where she just didn't put the effort into doing what she was meant to do. So I did confront her about it  and she told me that she hadn't had time to do the necessary work. So I just said  just block out some time in your schedule  and let's meet up and let's do the work together  and we were able to produce  um  I guess a very good product at the end of the day.|Interviewer: And if you were given the option to change one thing about yourself  what would it be?|Interviewee: The option to change one thing? I think I would be more outgoing in the terms of speaking  being able to speak to others more freely and confidently  because at the moment  I do speak with people I don't know and do work with people that aren't my friends or aren't in my social circle  but I wish I was more outgoing in the sense of I was more comfortable speaking with other people and interacting with other people  things like that.|Interviewer: Okay. And why do you think you should get the job?|Interviewee: I think I should get the job because I have a very strong academic background.|Interviewer: Mmm.|Interviewee: I have experiences in different companies thus far in my very short academic career  and I think I've been able to work with a variety of people. I would be an asset to any team I'm a part of.,5.374010758991867,5.314518192119719
